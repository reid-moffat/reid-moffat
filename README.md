### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year software design student at Queen's University (Canada)

What I've been working on:
* A course distribution website (https://qubirdhunter.com/)
* A point-maximizing cribbage algorithm
* A collaborative list app (hopefully releasing this fall)
* A personal website (https://reid-moffat.github.io/)
* Overhauling a couple previous Processing projects

I enjoy using Python and Java for development the most, but have been broadening my scope to learn more languages like JS, React Native, C and C++

You can contact me at reid.moffat9@gmail.com
