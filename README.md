### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year software design student at Queen's University (Canada)

What I've been working on:

* A trip-planning app
* A new and improved version of battleship
* [Optimizing my efficiency with bash](https://github.com/reid-moffat/bash-shortcuts)
* A [course distribution website](https://qubirdhunter.com/)
* A [point-maximizing cribbage algorithm](https://github.com/reid-moffat/cribbage-strategy)
* A collaborative list app (hopefully releasing this fall)
* A [personal website](https://reid-moffat.github.io/)
* Overhauling a couple previous [Processing](https://processing.org/) projects

I'm primarily a back-end focused developer with experience with Python and Java, as well as an interest in Bash, C++, Firebase, JavaScript, and React [Native]
